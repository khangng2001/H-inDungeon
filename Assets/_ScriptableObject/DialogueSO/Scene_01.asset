  sentences:
  - "Hmmm\u2026mmmm. Hmmm\u2026Mmm"
  - Oh!
  - 'Pardon me, I was absorbed in thought. '
  - Discovering this dungeon for many years made me doubt the tale from many years
    since.
  - No one hath seen the crazy magician mentioned in the story since the day that
    an old man emerged from this dungeon. How could we possibly beat something we 
    hast ne'r seen ere?
  - I wonder if that self-proclaimed king old man was telling the truth. About becoming
    the lord of the golden kingdom if the magician is defeated
  - Maybe tale is always tale
  - Are thou going to hie down? oh, just forbear doing that! Thou shall stop conquering
    this dungeon just like me
  - Where is thy little mage sister? I see her always around thou.
  - Stuck in that pit? Oh dear! That is really unfortune.
  - That creature hath stopped many adventures to go further, once  they  face  it, 
    they hardly survive
  - "Yet  we canst not die in this dungeon right ? Haaa\u2026 Haaaa\u2026 haaaa"
  - Oh sorry, mine bad.  Thou should'st hurry up and looking for her.  Ere she is
    digested
  - "But be careful for yourself you don\u2019t want die before save her right?"
